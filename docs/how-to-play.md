**How to Play Klondike Solitaire**

**Objective**  
The goal of Klondike Solitaire is to build four foundation piles – one for each suit – in ascending order from Ace to King.

**Setup**  
1. **Tableau Layout:**  
   - Lay out seven piles in a row.  
   - In the first pile, place one card; in the second, two cards; continue until the seventh pile has seven cards.  
   - Turn the top card of each pile face-up; all other cards remain face-down.

2. **Stock and Waste:**  
   - The remaining cards form the stock.  
   - Cards from the stock will be flipped over to form a waste pile as you play.

3. **Foundations:**  
   - Leave space in the upper area for four foundation piles, one for each suit.

**Gameplay**  
1. **Building the Tableau:**  
   - Move cards between tableau piles to create descending sequences in alternating colors (red on black or black on red).  
   - Only a King (or a sequence starting with a King) can be moved to an empty tableau space.
   - If a face-down card is uncovered, turn it face-up immediately.

2. **Using the Stock:**  
   - Flip one card at a time (or three, if you prefer that variant) from the stock to the waste pile.  
   - Use the visible card from the waste if it can be played on a tableau pile or moved to a foundation.

3. **Building the Foundations:**  
   - Start each foundation with an Ace, then add cards in increasing order (2, 3, 4, …, King) of the same suit.
   - Move cards to the foundations as opportunities arise during gameplay.

**Winning the Game**  
You win when all cards are successfully transferred from the tableau and the waste to the foundation piles, arranged in order from Ace to King for each suit.

Enjoy the challenge of rearranging your cards, and may every shuffle bring you closer to victory!
